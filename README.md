1- Nettoyage de donn√©es et transformation

2- Analyse de donn√©es avec visualisations Python (Seaborn, Plotly express)

3- Regression lin√©aire et pr√©diction

Perform a variety of linear regressions with different inputs. It's up to you to find the most relevant X variables. The target (y) will be the price column. Remember to train-test split your dataset to get a relevant score, and print your test-set R2-score. Compare it with Train score to avoid overfitting.
The last 4 rows don't have price. You'll have to predict prices and print your prediction.
